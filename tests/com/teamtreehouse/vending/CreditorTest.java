/** ENTRY 2: RUNNING TESTS AND READING OUTPUTS
 *  1.  One thing you need to add to this test class is the throws Exception and change the test method to testRefund()
 *      NOTE: I know this is not the best practice but please play along for now
 *  2.  Then we can initialize test run by right click the tests directory and click Run.
 *      After this we can just press the run icon button since it will be set to run all the main and the test
 *  3.  Now we are going to test if it really can fail by using the org.junit.Assert method called fail().
 *      NOTE: since org.junit.Assert.* is an import static package you can just code the method name ie: fail() without
 *          need to use Assert.fail() for instance since it was already static (instantiated, loaded when compiled)
 *  NEXT: ENTRY 3: ASSERTIONS
